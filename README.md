It looks like I don't have the ability to directly upload files to your GitHub repository. However, I can guide you on how to do it yourself.

Here are the steps to create a profile README on GitHub:

1. **Create a new repository**: The repository's name should be the same as your GitHub username. For example, if your username is `VybsX`, the repository's name should be `VybsX`.

2. **Add the README file**: Create a file named `README.md` in the new repository.

3. **Copy the content**: Copy the following content into the `README.md` file:

```markdown name=README.md
# Hi there, I'm VybsX! 👋
